title: Thank you Formation Project!
---

In 2019, I had the good fortune of participating in The Formation Project, a year-long experiment in deepening into _________ with the support of a small group of people facilitated by Gabriel Wilson. Today, I attended a gathering where the current stewarding team began transitioning some of the roles to new people. 

I felt a little vulnerable showing up, given how little I could commit to, beyond offering a very enthusiastic testimonial for fundraisers.

But, I left feeling inspired by the team, and their ability to hold change. 

Afterwards, I started reading lawrence q. barriner's blog posts, not for the first time. And I thought: I'd love to have a blog like that. To think out loud, to share my vision and values, and to share book reviews and perspective on somatic transformation.
